============

I gave a talk at CodeMash 2015 on using gulp to manage your frontend development workflow. These are the slides for that talk.

The slides were made with [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

The [fridgewords](https://github.com/bengladwell/fridgewords) project was created specifically for this talk as a reference project.
